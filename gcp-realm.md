## 🧙‍♀️ Chapter 3: The Storage Vaults (Data & Databases)

### 📚 The Great Libraries

## 🛡️ Chapter 4: The Protective Wards (Security & Identity)

### 🔐 **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** - The Royal Guard

Control who can access what in your kingdom:

```
👑 Roles & Permissions Hierarchy:
- Owner: The Sovereign Ruler (full control)
- Editor: The Trusted Advisor (can modify most things)
- Viewer: The Court Observer (read-only access)
- Custom Roles: Specialized positions you create
```

### 🛡️ **Security Best Practices** - The Knight's Code

1. **🔑 Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum powers needed
2. **🔄 Regular Key Rotation**: Change your magical keys frequently
3. **📊 Audit Logging**: Keep records of all kingdom activities
4. **🚫 Never Store Secrets in Code**: Use Secret Manager for sensitive spells
